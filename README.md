Values-Only-PDF
===============
This plugin allows project users to print PDFs that only include the fields on the instrument with data entered. 
Blank/null fields are not included on the PDF. End-users must navigate to a record's data collection instrument 
and then click on the project bookmark link to initiate. To implement: check the "Append project ID to URL" and 
"Append record info to URL" options. For some projects, people might want to give access to all users, and for 
other projects you might want to restrict it to specific users (those who can have access to the data / export).
If you have any questions or comments on this code please send email to rcc@partners.org.
